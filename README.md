# LabSeq
API Rest implementation of the LabSeq sequence

Notes

- To start the frontend, open your command line in the repository location, inside frontend and type: ng serve
- To start the backend, you need a sprint initializer like https://start.spring.io/ or you can run locally on your pc
- Unfortanely, in the frontend, its impossible to display the intire number in the display box due to the limitations of String variables ang BigInt.
